      Dear Ishita (loml) <br><br>
      I wanted to do something small but meaningful for you.

      Thank you for being the ray of sunshine and happiness in 
      my life, you are the prettiest girl in the world, and you
      deserve all the happiness that gets in your way, i wish
      i could hug you rn but unfortunately you are lil far away 
      i hope i can see you soon and we go somewhere to have a nice 
      lunch, okay so concluding this letter, i just wanna thank you 
      for always being there for me in my best and the worst times,
      i am so grateful that i have someone like you in my life.
